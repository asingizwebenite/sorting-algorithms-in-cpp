# 🧮 Sorting Algorithms in C++

This project demonstrates the implementation of popular sorting algorithms in **C++**. It serves as both a learning resource and a reference for understanding how different sorting techniques work under the hood.

## 🔧 Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- C++11 or higher

## 🏁 How to Run

1. **Compile the code**  
   Use any C++ compiler. Example with `g++`:

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o sorting
   ```

2. **Run the executable**

   ```bash
   ./sorting
   ```

   You can edit `main.cpp` to test different algorithms with sample arrays.

## ✨ Implemented Algorithms

<pre lang="markdown">

 | Algorithm        | Time Complexity (Average) | Space Complexity | Stability |
 |------------------|---------------------------|------------------|-----------|
 | Bubble Sort      | O(n²)                     | O(1)             | ✅ Stable |
 | Selection Sort   | O(n²)                     | O(1)             | ❌        |
 | Insertion Sort   | O(n²)                     | O(1)             | ✅ Stable |
    </pre>

> Note: For large datasets, Quick Sort and Merge Sort tend to perform better than simple algorithms like Bubble or Insertion Sort.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

- Understand different sorting techniques and when to use them.
- Practice writing efficient and readable C++ code.
- Learn about time and space trade-offs.
